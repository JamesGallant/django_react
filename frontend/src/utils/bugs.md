# Bug database

## Introduction
This document logs the current known bugs in the database. It is advised to convert this to a more formal database that can be automated. 

## How to report
If you spot a bug in one of the components that exists as a result of our code or a third party dependancy log it here. If its a mission critical bug, it should have a high priority, bugs that impede some internal functionality are moderate and bugs that are aesthetic in nature are low. Bugs should be fixed before any major releases.
